		<p class="para_format"> Lets get started with CSS. To get started you will need
			to have working knowledge of external CSS
			style sheets. In the style sheet target a
			div with a class of &quot;demo&quot;. Set its
			background-color: black; and a height:100px;
			and width:100px;. Now you should see your div has
			become a black box, now add a border-radius:100px;
			and now you have yourself a circle. Now here comes
			the important stuff. Below that class add a new element this
			will be where the animation happens. Type @keyframes
			demoAnimation{}. Now you have an animation parameter
			set called &quot;demoAnimations&quot;. Within those curly
			braces add from{} and to{} on their own lines. Now
			we can add what we want to happen within those. If
			you search online you will find tons of things to
			put in there but for now let&#39;s stick with changing
			colors and motion.
			Add the following into the code.
		</p>
		<div class="code"><code>from{ background-color:black; transform: translateX(50px);}
			to{background-color:red; transform: translateX(150px);}
		</code></div>
		<p class="para_format">And in the class add this
			code and I will explain.</p>
		<div class="code">
		<code>
			margin-left: 200px;
			animation-name: demoAnimation;
			animation-duration: 2s;
			animation-iteration-count: infinite;
			animation-direction: alternate;</code>
