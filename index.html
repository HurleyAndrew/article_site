		<p class="para_format"> Lets get started with CSS. To get started you will need
			to have working knowledge of external CSS
			style sheets. In the style sheet target a
			div with a class of “demo”. Set its
			background-color: black; and a height:100px;
			and width:100px;. Now you should see your div has
			become a black box, now add a border-radius:100px;
			and now you have yourself a circle. Now here comes
			the important stuff. Below that class add a new element this will be where the animation happens. Type @keyframes demoAnimation{}. Now you have an animation parameter set called “demoAnimations”. Within those curly braces add from{} and to{} on their own lines. Now we can add what we want to happen within those. If you search online you will find tons of things to put in there but for now let’s stick with changing colors and motion.
			Add the following into the code.
